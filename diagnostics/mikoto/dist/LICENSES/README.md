# Upstream firmware notices

The SuperMini runtime is the official CircuitPython 10.3.1 binary for `supermini_nrf52840`, downloaded without modification. Its source is at https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/tree/10.3.1. CircuitPython is based on MicroPython and includes additional port/vendor code; see that tree's file-level notices and license directories as well as the included main license.

The Mikoto images are built from ZMK with Zephyr and Nordic device support. `../BUILD.json` identifies the source/compiler and `../west-frozen.yml` identifies all dependency source repositories and exact commits. Included notices retain the ZMK MIT license, Zephyr Apache 2.0 license and the Nordic device runtime copyright/license. The complete upstream source trees retain their component-specific notices.

The fixture's own source module and host tools are in the parent project's diagnostics directory. The UF2 files contain application code only, not a bootloader update or a bundled Nordic SoftDevice replacement.
